	abstract = {Spherical tokamaks have many desirable features that make them an attractive choice for a future fusion power plant. Power-plant viability is intrinsically related to plasma heat and particle confinement, and this is often determined by the level of micro-instability-driven turbulence. Accurate calculation of the properties of turbulent microinstabilities is therefore critical for tokamak design; however, the evaluation of these properties is computationally expensive. The considerable number of geometric and thermodynamic parameters and the high resolutions required to accurately resolve these instabilities make repeated use of direct numerical simulations in integrated modeling workflows extremely computationally challenging and create the need for fast, accurate, reduced-order models. This paper outlines the development of a data-driven reduced-order model, often termed a surrogate model for the properties of micro-tearing modes ({MTMs}) across a spherical tokamak reactor-relevant parameter space utilizing Gaussian process regression and classification, techniques from machine learning. These two components are used in an active learning loop to maximize the efficiency of data acquisition, thus minimizing computational cost. The high-fidelity gyrokinetic code {GS}2 is used to calculate the linear properties of the {MTMs}: the mode growth rate, frequency, and normalized electron heat flux, and core components of a quasi-linear transport model. Data cross-validation and direct validation on unseen data are used to ascertain the performance of the resulting surrogate models.},

However, the basic mechanism of advection due to electrostatic potential driven by the diamagnetic current can be captured in a much simpler model; a complete understanding of the physics in the simpler model will then aid interpretation of more complex simulations, by allowing the new effects to be disentangled. Here we consider such a simple model, which assumes cold ions and isothermal electrons and is reduced to two dimensions. We derive the scaling with width and amplitude of the velocity of isolated scrape-off layer filaments, allowing for arbitrary elliptical cross-sections, where previously only circular cross-sections have been considered analytically. We also put the scaling with amplitude in a new and more satisfactory form. The analytical results are extensively validated with two dimensional simulations and also compared, with reasonable agreement, to three dimensional simulations having minimal variation parallel to the magnetic field.},

	abstract = {This paper presents simulations of isolated 3D filaments in a slab geometry obtained using a newly developed 3D reduced fluid code, written using the {BOUT}++ framework. First, systematic scans were performed to investigate how the dynamics of a filament are affected by its amplitude, perpendicular size, and parallel extent. The perpendicular size of the filament was found to have a strong influence on its motions, as it determined the relative importance of parallel currents to polarization and viscous currents, whilst drift-wave instabilities were observed if the initial amplitude of the blob was increased sufficiently. Next, the 3D simulations were compared to 2D simulations using different parallel closures; namely, the sheath dissipation closure, which neglects parallel gradients, and the vorticity advection closure, which neglects the influence of parallel currents. The vorticity advection closure was found to not replicate the 3D perpendicular dynamics and overestimated the initial radial acceleration of all the filaments studied. In contrast, a more satisfactory comparison with the sheath dissipation closure was obtained, even in the presence of significant parallel gradients, where the closure is no longer valid. Specifically, it captured the contrasting dynamics of filaments with different perpendicular sizes that were observed in the 3D simulations which the vorticity advection closure failed to replicate. However, neither closure successfully replicated the Boltzmann spinning effects nor the associated poloidal drift of the blob that was observed in the 3D simulations. Although the sheath dissipation closure was concluded to be more successful in replicating the 3D dynamics, it is emphasized that the vorticity advection closure may still be relevant for situations where the parallel current is inhibited from closing through the sheath due to effects such as strong magnetic shear around X points or increased resistivity near the targets.},

	abstract = {Results on edge turbulence in periods separating edge localised modes ({ELMs}), i.e. inter-{ELM} periods, in Mega-Amp Spherical Tokamak ({MAST}) are presented. It is shown through combined measurements of fast camera images and reciprocating Langmuir probes that filamentary structures contribute to transport during these periods. Analysis of Dα light emission reveals that inter-{ELM} filaments are the lowest amplitude fluctuations in the {MAST} scrape-off layer ({SOL}) relative to L-mode and {ELM} filaments. Physical properties such as size, density and mode numbers have also been characterized, along with measurements of the spatio-temporal evolution: inter-{ELM} filaments are found to rotate in the vicinity of the last closed flux surface and propagate radially outwards. Motion of these filaments is found to depend strongly on plasma density such that with increasing density, there is an enhancement of the radial transport manifested by an increased number of filaments which leave the edge and travel faster into the {SOL}. Camera images show that intermittent fluctuations in ion saturation current signals correspond to inter-{ELM} filaments passing the probe. Measured radial e-folding lengths indicate larger decay lengths at higher densities. Similar trends are also obtained in simulations of a filament propagating radially and losing particles on ion parallel loss timescales. Finally, a discussion is presented on how the radial velocity and Isat measurements reported in this paper are used to test the velocity scalings predicted by different theories.},

According to filament models, their propagation may follow different regimes depending on the parallel closure of charge conservation. This is of paramount importance in magnetic fusion plasmas, as high collisionality in the scrape-off layer may trigger a regime transition leading to strongly enhanced perpendicular particle fluxes. This work reports for the first time on an experimental verification of this process, linking enhanced transport with a regime transition as predicted by models. Based on these results, a novel scaling for global perpendicular particle transport in reactor relevant tokamaks such as {ASDEX}-Upgrade and {JET} is found, leading to important implications for next generation fusion devices.},

Following a basic discussion of vorticity generation, ballooning, and the role of sheaths, a two-field interchange model is studied by means of numerical simulations on a biperiodic domain perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is demonstrated that a blob-like plasma structure develops dipolar vorticity and electrostatic potential fields, resulting in rapid radial acceleration and formation of a steep front and a trailing wake. While the dynamical evolution strongly depends on the amount of collisional diffusion and viscosity, the structure travels a radial distance many times its initial size in all parameter regimes in the absence of sheath dissipation. In the ideal limit, there is an inertial scaling for the maximum radial velocity of isolated filaments. This velocity scales as the acoustic speed times the square root of the structure size relative to the length scale of the magnetic field. The plasma filament eventually decelerates due to mixing and collisional dissipation. Finally, the role of sheath dissipation is investigated. When included in the simulations, it significantly reduces the radial velocity of isolated filaments. The results are discussed in the context of convective transport in scrape-off layer plasmas, comprising both blob-like structures in low confinement modes and edge localized mode filaments in unstable high confinement regimes.},

We start with a brief historical survey of experimental data and the main ideas on edge and {SOL} plasma transport, which finally evolved into the modern paradigm of convective very-intermittent cross-field edge plasma transport. We show that both extensive analytic treatments and numerical simulations demonstrate that plasma blobs with enhanced pressure can be convected coherently towards the wall. The mechanism of convection is related to an effective gravity force (e.g. owing to magnetic curvature effects), which causes plasma polarization and a corresponding E× B convection. The impacts of different effects (e.g. X-point magnetic geometry, plasma collisionality, plasma beta, etc.) on blob dynamics are considered. Theory and simulation predict, both for current tokamaks and for {ITER}, blob propagation speeds and cross-field sizes to be of the order of a few hundred meters per second and a centimeter, respectively, which are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, the concept of blobs as a fundamental entity of convective transport in the scrape-off layer provides explanations for observed outwards convective transport, intermittency and non-Gaussian statistics in edge plasmas, and enhanced wall recycling in both toroidal and linear machines.},

The results are tested against existing theoretical scalings of blob velocity (Myra et al 2006 Phys. Plasmas). The complementary analysis of the 3D structure of the filaments shows how they disconnect from the divertor plate in the vicinity of the X-points, leading to a transition from a sheath-connected regime to the ideal-interchange one. Furthermore, the numerical results show non-negligible effects of the turbulent background plasma: approximately half of the detected filaments are involved in mutual interactions, eventually resulting in negative radial velocities, and a fraction of the filaments is generated by turbulence directly below the X-point.},

Initial simulations of seeded plasma filaments in a non-axisymmetric geometry are reported. We characterize filaments propagating in the closed-field-line region of a low-field-period, rotating ellipse equilibrium as inertially-limited by examining the velocity scaling and currents associated with the filament propagation.

The underlying mechanism considered is due to the nonlinear evolution of interchange motions, without any presumption of plasma sheaths. Theoretical arguments supported by numerical simulations reveal an inertial scaling for the radial velocity of isolated structures in the ideal limit. This velocity increases as the square root of the structure size relative to the length scale of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the radial advection velocity, as well as the dynamical evolution of the structures, compares favorably with recent experimental measurements of radially propagating blob structures in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas.},

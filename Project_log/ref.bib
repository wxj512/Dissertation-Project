For this purpose, in addition to classical analysis techniques, we apply here a novel fully 3D blob recognition and tracking (BRAT) algorithm, allowing for the first time to resolve the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of the blobs in a turbulent 3D plasma featuring a realistic magnetic geometry. The results are tested against existing theoretical scalings of blob velocity (Myra et al 2006 Phys. Plasmas). The complementary analysis of the 3D structure of the filaments shows how they disconnect from the divertor plate in the vicinity of the X-points, leading to a transition from a sheath-connected regime to the ideal-interchange one. Furthermore, the numerical results show non-negligible effects of the turbulent background plasma: approximately half of the detected filaments are involved in mutual interactions, eventually resulting in negative radial velocities, and a fraction of the filaments is generated by turbulence directly below the X-point.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, in addition to traditional qualitative methods, quantitative techniques are also a standard tool to describe biological systems behavior. An example is the broad class of mathematical models, based on differential equations, used in ecology, biochemical kinetics, epidemiology, gene regulatory networks, etc. Independent of their simplicity or complexity, all these models have in common (generally unknown a priori) parameters that need to be identified from observations (data) of the real system, usually available on the literature, obtained by specific assays or surveyed by public health offices. Before using this data to calibrate the models, a good practice is to judge the most influential parameters. That can be done with aid of the Sobol’ indices, a variance-based statistical technique for global sensitivity analysis, which measures the individual importance of each parameter, as well as their joint-effect, on the model output (a.k.a. quantity of interest). These variance-based indexes may be computed using Monte Carlo simulation but, depending on the model, this task can be very costly. An alternative approach for this scenario is the use of surrogate models to speed-up the calculations. Using simple biological models, from different areas, we develop a tutorial that illustrates how practitioners can use Sobol’ indices to quantify, in a probabilistic manner, the relevance of the parameters of their models. This tutorial describes a very robust framework to compute Sobol’ indices employing a polynomial chaos surrogate model constructed with the UQLab package.},

L. Luxon, Nucl. Fusion 42, 614 (2002)] in L- and H-mode discharges. Conditional averaging reveals that the IPOs are positively charged and feature internal poloidal electric fields of up to 4000 V/m. The IPOs move radially with E×BT/B2 velocities of ∼2600 m/s near the last closed flux surface (LCFS), and ∼330 m/s near the wall. The IPOs slow down as they shrink in size from 2 cm at the LCFS to 0.5 cm near the wall. The skewness (i.e., asymmetry of fluctuations from the average) of probe and beam emission spectroscopy data indicate IPO formation at or near the LCFS and the existence of positive and negative IPOs which move in opposite directions. The particle content of the IPOs at the LCFS is linearly dependent on the local density and decays over ∼3 cm into the SOL while their temperature decays much faster (∼1 cm).},

The model includes electric currents due to magnetic gradient and curvature drifts, polarization drifts, and parallel currents through sheaths, where the magnetic field lines intersect material walls. In the ideal limit, the radial velocity of the filament increases with the square root of its size. When sheath currents dominate over polarization currents, the filament velocity is inversely proportional to the square of its size. In the presence of sheath currents, the velocity is maximum for an intermediate filament size determined by the balance between diamagnetic, polarization, and sheath currents. The parameter dependence of this filament size and velocity is elucidated. The results are discussed in the context of blob-like structures in basic laboratory plasma experiments and in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas.},

	abstract = {Radial convection of isolated filamentary structures due to interchange motions in magnetized plasmas is investigated. Following a basic discussion of vorticity generation, ballooning, and the role of sheaths, a two-field interchange model is studied by means of numerical simulations on a biperiodic domain perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is demonstrated that a blob-like plasma structure develops dipolar vorticity and electrostatic potential fields, resulting in rapid radial acceleration and formation of a steep front and a trailing wake. While the dynamical evolution strongly depends on the amount of collisional diffusion and viscosity, the structure travels a radial distance many times its initial size in all parameter regimes in the absence of sheath dissipation. In the ideal limit, there is an inertial scaling for the maximum radial velocity of isolated filaments. This velocity scales as the acoustic speed times the square root of the structure size relative to the length scale of the magnetic field. The plasma filament eventually decelerates due to mixing and collisional dissipation. Finally, the role of sheath dissipation is investigated. When included in the simulations, it significantly reduces the radial velocity of isolated filaments. The results are discussed in the context of convective transport in scrape-off layer plasmas, comprising both blob-like structures in low confinement modes and edge localized mode filaments in unstable high confinement regimes.},

Indeed computer models (a.k.a simulators) are becoming more and more complex and demanding, yet the knowledge of the input parameters to feed into the model is usually limited. Based on the available data and possibly expert knowledge, parameters are represented by random variables. Of crucial interest is the propagation of the uncertainties through the simulator so as to estimate statistics of the quantities of interest. Monte Carlo simulation, a popular technique based on random number simulation, is unaffordable in practice when each simulator run takes minutes to hours. In this contribution we shortly review recent techniques to bypass Monte Carlo simulation, namely surrogate models. The basics of polynomial chaos expansions and low-rank tensor approximations are given together with hints on how to derive the statistics of interest, namely moments, sensitivity indices or probabilities of failure.},

	abstract = {Neural networks (NNs) are currently changing the computational paradigm on how to combine data with mathematical laws in physics and engineering in a profound way, tackling challenging inverse and ill-posed problems not solvable with traditional methods. However, quantifying errors and uncertainties in NN-based inference is more complicated than in traditional methods. This is because in addition to aleatoric uncertainty associated with noisy data, there is also uncertainty due to limited data, but also due to NN hyperparameters, overparametrization, optimization and sampling errors as well as model misspecification. Although there are some recent works on uncertainty quantification (UQ) in NNs, there is no systematic investigation of suitable methods towards quantifying the total uncertainty effectively and efficiently even for function approximation, and there is even less work on solving partial differential equations and learning operator mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using NNs. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework that includes uncertainty modeling, new and existing solution methods, as well as evaluation metrics and post-hoc improvement approaches. To demonstrate the applicability and reliability of our framework, we present an extensive comparative study in which various methods are tested on prototype problems, including problems with mixed input-output data, and stochastic problems in high dimensions. In the Appendix, we include a comprehensive description of all the UQ methods employed, which we will make available as open-source library of all codes included in this framework.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is an essential step in computational model validation because assessment of the model accuracy requires a concrete, quantifiable measure of uncertainty in the model predictions. The concept of UQ in the nuclear community generally means forward UQ (FUQ), in which the information flow is from the inputs to the outputs. Inverse UQ (IUQ), in which the information flow is from the model outputs and experimental data to the inputs, is an equally important component of UQ but has been significantly underrated until recently. FUQ requires knowledge of the input uncertainties, which has been widely specified by expert opinion or user self-evaluation. IUQ is the process of inversely quantifying the input uncertainties based on experimental data. Multiple IUQ methods have been developed in the nuclear community to quantify the input uncertainties in the physical models of system thermal-hydraulics codes. In this chapter, a brief overview of the IUQ methods will be provided. We will also introduce the Modular Bayesian Approach which has a very comprehensive formulation for IUQ.},

	abstract = {Biomechanical models often need to describe very complex systems, organs or diseases, and hence also include a large number of parameters. One of the attractive features of physics-based models is that in those models (most) parameters have a clear physical meaning. Nevertheless, the determination of these parameters is often very elaborate and costly and shows a large scatter within the population. Hence, it is essential to identify the most important parameters (worth the effort) for a particular problem at hand. In order to distinguish parameters which have a significant influence on a specific model output from non-influential parameters, we use sensitivity analysis, in particular the Sobol method as a global variance-based method. However, the Sobol method requires a large number of model evaluations, which is prohibitive for computationally expensive models. We therefore employ Gaussian processes as a metamodel for the underlying full model. Metamodelling introduces further uncertainty, which we also quantify. We demonstrate the approach by applying it to two different problems: nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in a complex, multiphase tumour-growth model, and arterial growth and remodelling. Even relatively small numbers of evaluations of the full model suffice to identify the influential parameters in both cases and to separate them from non-influential parameters. The approach also allows the quantification of higher-order interaction effects. We thus show that a variance-based global sensitivity analysis is feasible for complex, computationally expensive biomechanical models. Different aspects of sensitivity analysis are covered including a transparent declaration of the uncertainties involved in the estimation process. Such a global sensitivity analysis not only helps to massively reduce costs for experimental determination of parameters but is also highly beneficial for inverse analysis of such complex models.},

	abstract = {Simulating direct-drive inertial confinement experiments presents significant computational challenges, both due to the complexity of the codes required for such simulations and the substantial computational expense associated with target design studies. Machine learning models, and in particular, surrogate models, offer a solution by replacing simulation results with a simplified approximation. In this study, we apply surrogate modeling and optimization techniques that are well established in the existing literature to one-dimensional simulation data of a new cylindrical target design containing deuterium–tritium fuel. These models predict yields without the need for expensive simulations. We find that Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process surrogates enhances sampling efficiency in low-dimensional design spaces but becomes less efficient as dimensionality increases. Nonetheless, optimization routines within two-dimensional and five-dimensional design spaces can identify designs that maximize yield, while also aligning with established physical intuition. Optimization routines, which ignore constraints on hydrodynamic instability growth, are shown to lead to unstable designs in 2D, resulting in yield loss. However, routines that utilize 1D simulations and impose constraints on the in-flight aspect ratio converge on novel cylindrical target designs that are stable against hydrodynamic instability growth in 2D and achieve high yield.},

	title = {Automatic model construction with {Gaussian} processes},
	url = {https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/247281},
	abstract = {This thesis develops a method for automatically constructing, visualizing and describing a large class of models, useful for forecasting and finding structure in domains such as time series, geological formations, and physical dynamics. These models, based on Gaussian processes, can capture many types of statistical structure, such as periodicity, changepoints, additivity, and symmetries. Such structure can be encoded through kernels, which have historically been hand-chosen by experts. We show how to automate this task, creating a system that explores an open-ended space of models and reports the structures discovered. To automatically construct Gaussian process models, we search over sums and products of kernels, maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood. We show how any model in this class can be automatically decomposed into qualitatively different parts, and how each component can be visualized and described through text. We combine these results into a procedure that, given a dataset, automatically constructs a model along with a detailed report containing plots and generated text that illustrate the structure discovered in the data. The introductory chapters contain a tutorial showing how to express many types of structure through kernels, and how adding and multiplying different kernels combines their properties. Examples also show how symmetric kernels can produce priors over topological manifolds such as cylinders, toruses, and Möbius strips, as well as their higher-dimensional generalizations. This thesis also explores several extensions to Gaussian process models. First, building on existing work that relates Gaussian processes and neural nets, we analyze natural extensions of these models to deep kernels and deep Gaussian processes. Second, we examine additive Gaussian processes, showing their relation to the regularization method of dropout. Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet process to produce the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering model having nonparametric cluster shapes, and a corresponding latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable parametric form.},

	abstract = {Spherical tokamaks have many desirable features that make them an attractive choice for a future fusion power plant. Power-plant viability is intrinsically related to plasma heat and particle confinement, and this is often determined by the level of micro-instability-driven turbulence. Accurate calculation of the properties of turbulent microinstabilities is therefore critical for tokamak design; however, the evaluation of these properties is computationally expensive. The considerable number of geometric and thermodynamic parameters and the high resolutions required to accurately resolve these instabilities make repeated use of direct numerical simulations in integrated modeling workflows extremely computationally challenging and create the need for fast, accurate, reduced-order models. This paper outlines the development of a data-driven reduced-order model, often termed a surrogate model for the properties of micro-tearing modes (MTMs) across a spherical tokamak reactor-relevant parameter space utilizing Gaussian process regression and classification, techniques from machine learning. These two components are used in an active learning loop to maximize the efficiency of data acquisition, thus minimizing computational cost. The high-fidelity gyrokinetic code GS2 is used to calculate the linear properties of the MTMs: the mode growth rate, frequency, and normalized electron heat flux, and core components of a quasi-linear transport model. Data cross-validation and direct validation on unseen data are used to ascertain the performance of the resulting surrogate models.},

This model includes electrostatic 3D effects, such as resistive drift waves and blob spinning, while retaining all of the fundamental 2D physics of sheath connected plasma blobs. If the growth time of unstable drift waves is comparable to the 2D advection time scale of the blob, then the blob’s density gradient will be depleted resulting in a much more diffusive blob with little radial motion. Furthermore, blob profiles that are initially varying along the field line drive the potential to a Boltzmann relation that spins the blob and thereby acts as an addition sink of the 2D potential. Basic dimensionless parameters are presented to estimate the relative importance of these two 3D effects. The deviation of blob dynamics from that predicted by 2D theory in the appropriate limits of these parameters is demonstrated by a direct comparison of 2D and 3D seeded blob simulations.},

In this paper, physical arguments suggesting the importance of blob transport [S. I. Krasheninnikov, Phys. Lett. A 283, 368 (2001)] have been extended by calculations using a three-field fluid model, treating the blobs as coherent propagating structures. The properties of density, temperature and vorticity blobs, and methods of averaging over ensembles of blobs to get the average SOL profiles, are illustrated. The role of ionization of background neutrals in sustaining the density blob transport is also discussed. Many qualitative features of the experiments, such as relatively flat density profiles and transport coefficients increasing toward the wall, are shown to emerge naturally from the blob transport paradigm.},

In experiments and simulations, these intermittent filaments are often formed near the boundary between open and closed field lines, and seem to arise in theory from the saturation process for the dominant edge instabilities and turbulence. Blobs become charge-polarized under the action of an external force which causes unequal drifts on ions and electrons; the resulting polarization-induced E × B drift moves the blobs radially outwards across the scrape-off-layer (SOL). Since confined plasmas generally are subject to radial or outwards expansion forces (e.g., curvature and ∇B forces in toroidal plasmas), blob transport is a general phenomenon occurring in nearly all plasmas. This paper reviews the relationship between the experimental and theoretical results on blob formation, dynamics and transport and assesses the degree to which blob theory and simulations can be compared and validated against experiments.},

We show that both extensive analytic treatments and numerical simulations demonstrate that plasma blobs with enhanced pressure can be convected coherently towards the wall. The mechanism of convection is related to an effective gravity force (e.g. owing to magnetic curvature effects), which causes plasma polarization and a corresponding E× B convection. The impacts of different effects (e.g. X-point magnetic geometry, plasma collisionality, plasma beta, etc.) on blob dynamics are considered. Theory and simulation predict, both for current tokamaks and for ITER, blob propagation speeds and cross-field sizes to be of the order of a few hundred meters per second and a centimeter, respectively, which are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, the concept of blobs as a fundamental entity of convective transport in the scrape-off layer provides explanations for observed outwards convective transport, intermittency and non-Gaussian statistics in edge plasmas, and enhanced wall recycling in both toroidal and linear machines.},

It is shown through combined measurements of fast camera images and reciprocating Langmuir probes that filamentary structures contribute to transport during these periods. Analysis of Dα light emission reveals that inter-ELM filaments are the lowest amplitude fluctuations in the MAST scrape-off layer (SOL) relative to L-mode and ELM filaments. Physical properties such as size, density and mode numbers have also been characterized, along with measurements of the spatio-temporal evolution: inter-ELM filaments are found to rotate in the vicinity of the last closed flux surface and propagate radially outwards. Motion of these filaments is found to depend strongly on plasma density such that with increasing density, there is an enhancement of the radial transport manifested by an increased number of filaments which leave the edge and travel faster into the SOL. Camera images show that intermittent fluctuations in ion saturation current signals correspond to inter-ELM filaments passing the probe. Measured radial e-folding lengths indicate larger decay lengths at higher densities. Similar trends are also obtained in simulations of a filament propagating radially and losing particles on ion parallel loss timescales. Finally, a discussion is presented on how the radial velocity and Isat measurements reported in this paper are used to test the velocity scalings predicted by different theories.},

Following a basic discussion of vorticity generation, ballooning, and the role of sheaths, a two-field interchange model is studied by means of numerical simulations on a biperiodic domain perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is demonstrated that a blob-like plasma structure develops dipolar vorticity and electrostatic potential fields, resulting in rapid radial acceleration and formation of a steep front and a trailing wake. While the dynamical evolution strongly depends on the amount of collisional diffusion and viscosity, the structure travels a radial distance many times its initial size in all parameter regimes in the absence of sheath dissipation. In the ideal limit, there is an inertial scaling for the maximum radial velocity of isolated filaments. This velocity scales as the acoustic speed times the square root of the structure size relative to the length scale of the magnetic field. The plasma filament eventually decelerates due to mixing and collisional dissipation. Finally, the role of sheath dissipation is investigated. When included in the simulations, it significantly reduces the radial velocity of isolated filaments. The results are discussed in the context of convective transport in scrape-off layer plasmas, comprising both blob-like structures in low confinement modes and edge localized mode filaments in unstable high confinement regimes.},

	abstract = {In a wide variety of natural and laboratory magnetized plasmas, filaments appear as a result of interchange instability. These convective structures substantially enhance transport in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. According to filament models, their propagation may follow different regimes depending on the parallel closure of charge conservation. This is of paramount importance in magnetic fusion plasmas, as high collisionality in the scrape-off layer may trigger a regime transition leading to strongly enhanced perpendicular particle fluxes. This work reports for the first time on an experimental verification of this process, linking enhanced transport with a regime transition as predicted by models. Based on these results, a novel scaling for global perpendicular particle transport in reactor relevant tokamaks such as ASDEX-Upgrade and JET is found, leading to important implications for next generation fusion devices.},

	abstract = {Plasma filaments have been observed by reciprocating electric probes in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator. Comparison with target probes indicates that a filament observed in the W7-X SOL extends to the sheath. Two-dimensional simulations of seeded filaments exhibit good quantitative agreement with experimental measurements in filament velocity scalings, despite an assumption of constant field line curvature. Both experiment and simulation show a slow radial propagation of filaments, indicating that filaments are essentially bound to their flux surface and do not perform ballistic radial motion. In contrast, the poloidal propagation along flux surfaces is much faster than the radial motion.},

	abstract = {A complete model of the dynamics of scrape-off layer filaments will be rather complex, including temperature evolution, three dimensional geometry and finite Larmor radius effects. However, the basic mechanism of advection due to electrostatic potential driven by the diamagnetic current can be captured in a much simpler model; a complete understanding of the physics in the simpler model will then aid interpretation of more complex simulations, by allowing the new effects to be disentangled. Here we consider such a simple model, which assumes cold ions and isothermal electrons and is reduced to two dimensions. We derive the scaling with width and amplitude of the velocity of isolated scrape-off layer filaments, allowing for arbitrary elliptical cross-sections, where previously only circular cross-sections have been considered analytically. We also put the scaling with amplitude in a new and more satisfactory form. The analytical results are extensively validated with two dimensional simulations and also compared, with reasonable agreement, to three dimensional simulations having minimal variation parallel to the magnetic field.},

	abstract = {The formation of plasma blobs is studied by analyzing their trajectories in a gyrofluid simulation in the vicinity of the separatrix. Most blobs arise at the maximum radial electric field outside the separatrix. In general, blob generation is not bound to one particular radial position or instability. A simple model of turbulence spreading for the scrape-off layer is derived. The simulations show that the blob dynamics can be represented by turbulence spreading, which constitutes a substantial energy drive for far scrape-off layer turbulence and is a more suitable quantity to study blob generation compared to the skewness.},

	abstract = {This paper presents simulations of isolated 3D filaments in a slab geometry obtained using a newly developed 3D reduced fluid code, written using the BOUT++ framework. First, systematic scans were performed to investigate how the dynamics of a filament are affected by its amplitude, perpendicular size, and parallel extent. The perpendicular size of the filament was found to have a strong influence on its motions, as it determined the relative importance of parallel currents to polarization and viscous currents, whilst drift-wave instabilities were observed if the initial amplitude of the blob was increased sufficiently. Next, the 3D simulations were compared to 2D simulations using different parallel closures; namely, the sheath dissipation closure, which neglects parallel gradients, and the vorticity advection closure, which neglects the influence of parallel currents. The vorticity advection closure was found to not replicate the 3D perpendicular dynamics and overestimated the initial radial acceleration of all the filaments studied. In contrast, a more satisfactory comparison with the sheath dissipation closure was obtained, even in the presence of significant parallel gradients, where the closure is no longer valid. Specifically, it captured the contrasting dynamics of filaments with different perpendicular sizes that were observed in the 3D simulations which the vorticity advection closure failed to replicate. However, neither closure successfully replicated the Boltzmann spinning effects nor the associated poloidal drift of the blob that was observed in the 3D simulations. Although the sheath dissipation closure was concluded to be more successful in replicating the 3D dynamics, it is emphasized that the vorticity advection closure may still be relevant for situations where the parallel current is inhibited from closing through the sheath due to effects such as strong magnetic shear around X points or increased resistivity near the targets.},
